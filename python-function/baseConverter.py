"""
a. Write a program to convert a number from decimal notation to a number expressed in a number system whose base (radix) is a number between 2 and 9. 
The conversion is performed by repetitious divistion by the base to which a number is being converted and then taking the remainders of the division in the reverse order. 
For example, in converting to binary, the number 6 requires three such divisions: 6/2 = 3 remainder 0, 3/2 = 1 remainder 1, and finally, 1‚ÅÑ2 = 0 remainder 1. 
The remainders 0, 1 and 1 are put in the reverse order so that the binary equivalent of 6 is equal to 110.


b. Modify the program so that it can perform a conversion in the case when the base is a number between 11 and 27. 
Number systems with bases greater than 10 require more symbols. Therefore, use capital letters. 
For example, a hexadecimal system requires 16 digits: 0, 1.......A, B, C, D, E, F. In this system, decimal number 26 is equal to 1A.
